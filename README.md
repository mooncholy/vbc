# Virtual Book Club

##Project Description
This project resembles a social cataloging website that stores a collection of book 
details including title, author, name, ISBN 13, year of publishing, number of pages of 
the paperback version and book reviews. It has an affiliated stationary store managed 
by the admins which offers items that help enrich the reader's experience and 
encourage them to read more, such as book-inspired bookmarks, kindle night readers 
and note taking gadgets.

##Aim
The target is to provide the users with a complete database of book selections they 
navigate and explore, as well as make contributions with the books that they might find 
missing. Their submissions are then reviewed by the admins before being published to 
the website. To help the admins, users can volunteer for reviewing submissions and 
managing the site interactions.

##Inspiration:
*The main inspiration of this project is Goodreads website, the book-centric book 
reviewing site which was later purchased by Amazon. (visit: https://www.goodreads.com)
*The Design theme was heavily inspired by Natalya Demidova's Cosmetics project 
on Behance (visit: shorturl.at/DJLS8)
